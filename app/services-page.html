                        Google is the cornerstone of the global internet network and one of the absolute main advertising channels for any company seeking to have a chance at publicity or visibility to its users. Taking into account the stringent requirements of the search engine and painstakingly monitoring the latest trends in SEO and other parameters is vital to making sure that a website is listed, indexed and displayed at the top of Google’s search results.

                        The issue is the same when it comes to cryptocurrency projects seeking to advertise their products on Google. However, the Google ads for cryptocurrency projects have been banned since 2018, when the search engine imposed strict restrictions on the advertising of crypto offerings. Though the ban was total and was largely due to the presence of ICOs that have been branded as scams, the latest release of Google’s advertising policy has become a welcome reprieve for crypto projects.

                        Google ads for crypto projects have been reviewed and a new policy has been updated on August 3rd, 2020. The announcement released by the IT giant stated that cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets that aim to reach the audience of the United States have the right to post their crypto ads on Google if they comply with a number of requirements.

                        The given requirements that have come into force essentially replace those that have existed since March of 2018, when Google ads of cryptocurrency projects were banned altogether. Part of those requirements is still in place, as Google has reiterated that it will not be advertising any initial coin offerings, any sort of DeFi trading protocols, or the trade, sale, purchase or exchange of any cryptocurrency or digital assets. The IT giant has also stated that among the products that are still under ban for advertising are initial DEX offerings, token liquidity pools, celebrity cryptocurrency endorsements, unhosted wallets, unregulated DApps, and others.

                        It is sad that most cryptocurrency projects do not have the opportunity to leverage the power of Google advertising, considering the possibilities the network offers.

                        The opportunities that Google offers extend well beyond simple placement of ads on the index and their subsequent rating up the query charts. Google offers an extensive merchant suite that allows companies to tailor their promotion and strategies and ad placement based on a variety of parameters. Among them are geolocation, search queries based on keywords and previous search results of users, ad-based premium placement at the top of search results, and much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that adhering to search engine optimization strategies is vital when ensuring organic promotion and ad placement, since Google employs automated bots that roam websites in search of proper structures, links and keywords to organize placement of such websites in search queries based on relevance.
